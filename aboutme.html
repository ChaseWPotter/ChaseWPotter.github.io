   <b> About me </b>
</p>
<p> When I graduate I want to go to become some sort of computer science major. I plan to go to Collage of the Desert for 2 years and then transfer to UC San Diego. I want to go to those schools because they both have really good Computer Science programs. I chose this because it interests me and I think I will be able to make a good living off of it.</p>
<br>
<p> When it comes to strengths I am good at problem solving and like to get things done. I am known to be very calm but also outgoing. Ever since I was little I have always found little electronics facinating and got as many as I could. A major award I have gotten is my Eagle Scout earlier this year.</p>
<br>
<p>My experiences in this class have tought me that I can get stuff done when I want too. I also have realised I work really well with music on because I get distracted my the smallest of things.
