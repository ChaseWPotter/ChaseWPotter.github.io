    About me
</p>
<p> When I graduate I want to go to become some sort of computer science major. I plan to go to Collage of the Desert for 2 years and then transfer to UC San Diego. I want to go to those schools because they both have really good Computer Science programs. I chose this because it interests me and I think I will be able to make a good living off of it.</p>
<br>
<p> When it comes to strengths I am good at problem solving and like to get things done.
